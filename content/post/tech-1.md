The Amazon interview process is quite a strenuous well spoken about process. I didn't realise just how difficult it is until I experienced it first hand. The process consists of three rounds. Round 1 and round 2 are 1-on-1 interviews. The 3rd round is called the loop process which consists of consecutive interviews on the same day with people from the team you will be working with. For the interview process you need to know the "STAR" technique. If you don't know then have a look at these [Amazon behavioural interview questions](https://interviewgenie.com/blog-1/interviewing-at-amazon-behavioral-interview-questions).

I'm based in Cape Town, South Africa and I was interviewing for a Solutions Architect position in Dublin, Ireland.
My first interview was an one hour technical interview. The telephonic interview was with a senior architect from the Amazon London office. There was a few questions I did not know. The best advice I can give anyone going through the process... _be honest_. If I did not know the answer to a question I would mention that fact and indicate that my answer would be a guess.

My second telephonic interview was with the hiring manager. This was quite an interesting interview as most of the questions related to Amazon's 14 [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles). Know the leadership principles as they are an important part of the Amazon culture. I'm a shareholder in a small technology business and we went through a process of defining our "core values" which are very close to the Amazon leadership principles. For this reason I found it quite easy to associate with the leadership principles and had real life experiences which I could draw from to answer these types of questions.

It takes about a week for the recruiter to get back regarding the feedback on the interview and to arrange the next interview if you have passed the previous round.

For the loop process I was invited by Amazon to visit their office in Dublin. My interviews was scheduled for the Monday and they ensured I arrived in Dublin early Sunday morning so that I had sufficient time to rest for the Monday. The guys were amazing and made me feel really welcome. Chris was in my first interview and he made the effort to meet me before the interview and have some coffee to  calm the nerves and just have a chat. We spoke about his experience when relocating from London to Dublin. I also had to complete an assignment that I had to submit a week before the loop interviews. My first interview for the day specifically focussed on the technical section of the assignment.

To be successful in the loop process you need to have brushed up on your technical skills as well as knowing the leadership principles. For the leadership principles I found a bunch of questions on the internet and then used my CV to match experiences with the various questions. I then wrote down sample answers that I would have given if asked these questions in an interview. This was a tremendous help in preparing for the interviews and also reminding me of my experience I had written on my CV. This was much harder than you would imaging as there was 25+ years worth of work experience (projects, colleagues and companies) to remember.

If you are embarking on or are in the process of interviewing with Amazon then good luck. Enjoy the experience because as with most things in life, you are rewarded when putting in the effort and preparing sufficiently.
