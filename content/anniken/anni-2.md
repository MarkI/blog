In my last post I ended on starting puppy classes. This went really well and Anniken quickly progressed to obedience training.

I started with obedience training as I have been doing with all my dogs. I quickly realised that he was getting board with obedience. He would do what I was asking but I would always find him watching the agility dogs on the other side of the training field.

Agility training is not allowed at Cape Province Dog Club until the dog has completed basic obedience, has a good recall, and is at least 1 year old. We completed basic obedience and then completed CD (Companion Dog) 1 and CD 2. I had to continue obedience until he was old enough to join the agility class.
Obedience in the form of CD consists of some basic but important skills for you and your dog:

* Sit
* Down
* Stand
* Stay
* Wait
* Send to bed/blanket
* Send away
* Retrieve
* Socialising with other dogs
* And most importantly for agility - Recall


I would recommend Cape Province Dog Club to any handler. They are an amazing group of people. Anniken still has friends whom he met in puppy class. Hunter has also moved onto agility with Anniken and they remain friends today.
