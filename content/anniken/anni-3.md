He has taken to agility and we now try and compete at multiple disciplines; namely agility, dog jumping and games (snooker & gamblers).

Anniken was 1 year old when we joined the agility beginners class. Denise is an amazing beginner trainer and we learnt loads from her. As handlers we had to learn all the equipment and teach the dog what each piece of equipment was. The list equipment list for agility was:

* Jump
* Tunnel
* Weave poles
* A-frame
* Dog walk
* Tire jump
* Long jump
* See-saw

One of the hardest pieces of equipment that everyone struggles with are the weave poles. There is the lure method and the channel method. This is the standard method most people learn. However, I was lucky enough to have Debby Maltby introduce me to 2X2 training. If there is any advice I could offer then it would be to teach your dog weave poles using the 2X2 method. It is time consuming but within weeks Anniken and I were doing weaves from both sides and different entries. People are still amazed that a dog that has only been doing agility for 2 years is so strong at weave poles. I have to say it's all down to Debby's advice and 2X2 training.

We spent 6 months in beginners learning the basics before we moved on to the intermediate class. Here I met Joy Knighton-Fitt. She is really an inspirational trainer to whom I am extremely grateful. Anniken and I learnt to be a team. I also learnt that the real training is for me because as the bond between Anniken and myself grew he is doing exactly what I'm guiding him to do.

I will never forget the lines that Joy would always drill into us which continues to help me:

1. Prepare for the task
1. Survey your surroundings (not just the course but what is happening around it)
1. Turn off all emotion

There is also walking the course:

1. Repeat steps above
1. Walk the numbers first
1. Walk the dogs line
1. Walk the handlers line
1. Close your eyes and ensure you can remember the course
1. Run the course with your virtual dog
