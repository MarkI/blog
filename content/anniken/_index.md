This is a section dedicated to Anniken. The rescure we received from our friend who found him on the side of the road in Athlone. He joined our other 2 dogs Lee-Lu and Yoda. His breed is unknown as he is a cross and we have no idea of his mother or father.

He stole our hearts and has become an integral part of the family.
