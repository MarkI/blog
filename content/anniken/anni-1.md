Anniken became the latest addition to our family in September 2016. He was found by our friend Toni on the side of the road. We have always been partial to rescues and here was the ultimate rescue... malnourished, ears filled with sores and tummy full of worms.

Even though my wife Colleen did not want another pup in the family, he would not stop following her. She fell in love with him there and then.

That very day he was taken to the vet for shots, chipped and medication for ears & tummy. The vet estimated him at about 6 weeks which meant that since he had received his shots he would be able to join puppy classes as soon as he had recovered from the problems with his ears and the worms in his tummy.

I enrolled him into puppy classes a week later and we have been the best buddies since then. He was a real hit at puppy class as he has one of the most lovable face (and I don't say this because he is my dog).

I started with obedience training as I have been doing with all my dogs. I quickly realised that he was getting board with obedience. He would do what I was asking but I would always find him watching the agility dogs on the other side of the training fields.

Agility training is not allowed at Cape Province Dog Club until the dog has completed basic obedience, has a good recall, and is at least 1 year old.
