I was born in Cape Town in South African where I also completed an engineering degree at University of Cape Town.
I'm married to the lovely _Colleen Sampson_ and we have a beautiful daughter _Hannah Isaacs_.
The other member of our family is our dog _Anniken_. He is a rescue we got off the side of the street in Athlone (suburb in Cape Town).

I'm in the process of moving to Amazon Web Services as a Solutions Architect in their Dublin office.

My latest hobby is Dog Agility and Jumping. One day I hope to compete at international level. Until then I'm content with the occassional weekend competition.
